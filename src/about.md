Carey Pietsch ‘10 is a cartoonist best known for her work on the best selling series of graphic novels The Adventure Zone. She is also known for her fantasy comics and artwork that explore themes such as queerness, interpersonal relationships, and the relationship with the self. This exhibit is a display of her artwork from various projects and comics from her time as a Swarthmore student to her current works. This exhibit attempts not only to chronicle Pietsch’s published work, but also her relationship with and the importance of fanart and fan-created works. 

This virtual exhibit has been put together in conjunction with a physical exhibit in McCabe Library during March 2021, paired with a virtual visit by Carey Pietsch. This exhibit was made possible due to support from Swarthmore College’s Sager Fund. The Sager Fund of Swarthmore College was established in 1988 by alumnus Richard Sager ‘73, a leader in San Diego’s gay community. To combat homophobia and related discriminations, the Fund sponsors events focused on concerns of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities.

Curated by Nooria Ahmed ‘22 and librarian Maria Aghazarian. With special thanks to Yeh Seo Jung '23, Annette Newman, and Nabil Kashyap.
