The book contains hand-colored volvelles, moving paper wheels that function as astrolabes to determine the placement of the planets. Swarthmore's copy was given by Elizabeth Wilcox Schickele, whose son Peter graduated from Swarthmore in 1957. She gave the book, “In memory of Margaret Ionides Cochran, fine astronomer and friend.

The loose documents were in a box bound in green flock-paper .… When the White Box first appeared, more than thirty years after the Green Box, the relationship of the two collections of notes was not understood. It has taken time to appreciate that the distinction between them is small. All of the notes were written over the same period, and they all pertain to the same quest - to engage in an art of rigour and purpose, stripped of pretension, affectation, and commercialism, and above all devoid of vanity …. The Green Box is a selection from a great many notes - Duchamp said that its purpose is to act as an 'ideal catalogue' for the Large Glass. More than a catalogue, it is a commentary and a manual, a key, a map, and an instruction box. — Richard Hamilton and Ecke Bonk",

As his work gained attention, he was invited to use the U.S. Naval Observatory’s refractor. In 1882, Scribner & Sons published a portfolio of fifteen of his works as chromolithographs, a chemical process in which a color print is created using multiple lithographic stones. Today the Trouvelot portfolio is highly valued for its artistic rather than scientific merits. The work was originally part of the Sproul Observatory Library collection.\n",

This, I thought, would be the perfect way to present contents that might not be so pleasant after all.

The texts mix sadness and sweetness in equal proportions. —Julie Chen",

The book was purchased by Donald S. Stralem, prior to 1962. It was purchased by William E. Stockhausen prior to August 20, 1969, apparently through the Seven Gables Bookshop, in New York. Purchased by Michael M. Rea, probably from the 1974 sale. Rea, who died in 1996, donated part of his library, including the Poe book, to Swarthmore College.”\n\n",
